# Changes

## Breaking

The API has been revamped to provide a logical and correct API which unfortunately breaks compatibility with the (very broken) API of some other libraries...

The `publish` command has had various helpful overloads removed. That functionality has been replaced by various overloads of the `xPublish` function.

The 'x' stands for "expert" so **_only use these if you fully understand the consequences_** and make sure you read [Payload Handling](pl.md) first.

This is a regrettable step, but I spent **far** too long trying to support people who are simply unable to understand the correct way to handle an MQTT payload no matter *how* many times nor how clearly it is explained to them (you know who you are)

Put simply, the publish API works like every other MQTT library: for the payload you provide the address of a data buffer and its length - end of story. ***This is how MQTT works***

The xPublish variants provide some very useful additional functionality (*for people who understand how they work*) depending on what exactly you want the payload to represent to your app. They allow you to *safely* handle common data formats without any extra fiddly code of your own that everybody *does* need when using the bog-standard publish API.

All `xPublish` variants convert the supplied data type to a buffer address + length (just as you would have to do yourself using the bog-standard `publish` API) which then allows you to use the matching `xPayload` call to unpack the correct type in a memory-safe and consistent manner. If you don't understand the above, stick to the simple `publish` API.
